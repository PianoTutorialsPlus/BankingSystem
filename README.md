# BankingSystem

This project contains a test banking system with the following architecture:

- WPF
- REST API
- Clean Architecture

These patterns are included:

- CQRS 
- MVVM
- User Controls for separating UI elements
- DTOs

## Time Effort

- 10 min (initial prompt)
- 10 min (evaluating the result)
- 10 min (extending the prompt + evaluating the added/updated parts)
- 20 min (setup the project, adding references, adding folders)
- 40 min (filling the classes from the prompt)
- ca 30-60 min (debugging, adapting, etc)

## The Prompts
These prompts were used to complete the task:

### Prompt after evaluating

"I need to update the task first: 
- For UI, use a cominations of Windows and UserControls for SRP, starting with a ShellMainView 
- Implement a NavigationService for linking the Views to their corresponding ViewModels 

Second: Full repo scaffold (all files, ready to copy)
